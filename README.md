# pynashga: A Python implementation of Nash genetic algorithms

## Description
This bit of code is a Python implementation of Nash genetic algorithm. It attempts to find Nash equilibrium using an evolutionary approach.

## Nash equilibrium
In game theory Nash's equilibrium is a state in which no player can do any better (say in terms of a utility function) by changing his action plan as long as other players stick to their plans. If a problem is relatively complex, analytic solutions may be hard and this is where pynashga comes in.
